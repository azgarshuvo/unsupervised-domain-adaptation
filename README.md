## Unsupervised Domain Adaptation-UDA

Proposing a Unsupervised Domain Adaptation-UDA technique to counteract the negative impact of the domain gap when training the model on the source distribution and evaluating it on the target distribution. As it holds for any standard UDA framework, the quality of the domain alignment strategy shall essentially be assessed by looking at the gain obtained with the proposed framework over the so called source-only baseline. Here DialNet is used a baseline architecture. The accuracy is improved by using AlexNet and ResrNet network
